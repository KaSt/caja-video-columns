# caja-video-columns

Originally named nautilus-columns and published on Github here https://github.com/atareao/nautilus-columns is a nautilus extension to show metadata of images, PDFs and videos.

It used MediaInfo (called via a wrapper) to fetch video properties.

I modified it to remove image and PDFs metadata scavenging, only leaving video properties and this version uses FFMPEG (ffprobe) to discover them. 

The additional columns available are:
- Width: the video frame width
- Height: the video frame height
- Resolution: Width X Height
- Duration: the duration of the video
- Audio Format: the audio encoding
- Video Format: the video format
- Codec: the video codec
- Definition: whether the video is 1080p, 720p, 4K...
- Video/Audio: whether the video contains or not video / audio tracks

Three versions are available:
- Caja
- Nautilus
- Nemo

Builds are automatically available for Caja, Nautilus and Nemo in "Releases"

Take care.
